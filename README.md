About the repository
====================

This is a repository with completed test work.

**Task**
--------

Write a program that forms a new array of strings from an existing array of 
strings that are less long or equal to 3 characters. The initial array can be 
entered from the keyboard, or set at the start of the algorithm execution. When
deciding, it is not recommended to use collections, it is better to do only 
with arrays.

*Examples*:

[“Hello”, “2”, “world”, “:-)”] → [“2”, “:-)”]

[“1234”, “1567”, “-2”, “computer science”] → [“-2”]

[“Russia”, “Denmark”, “Kazan”] → []
